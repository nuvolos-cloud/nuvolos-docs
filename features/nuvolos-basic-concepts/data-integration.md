# Data integration

## What is data integration?

Nuvolos' data integration ensures that educators and researchers can access licensed data in the most efficient manner and integrate data into their regular workflow. In particular:

* Data can be accessed in Nuvolos applications natively.
* Data can be accessed in non-Nuvolos applications via standard API solutions.
* Data in Nuvolos is stored in a cloud-based, scalable, low-overhead SQL-compliant DBMS.
* Access to licensed data can be controlled by the organization owning the license.

## Why is data integration useful?

Data integration creates novel workflows in research and education.

### Data is accessible

Nuvolos makes it possible to fine-tune access to data both on an organization and on a research project level.

Organization-wide public data is viewable by any member, and it is also possible to define restricted datasets that are available only to specified users.

### Data is annotated

Nuvolos supports and encourages adding table and column descriptions to your data. This helps documentation and reusability of your projects.

### Data is vintaged

It is possible to maintain multiple vintages of a dataset via Nuvolos. This makes it possible to reference multiple time-states of a particular data set in research, further aiding the replicability of research.
