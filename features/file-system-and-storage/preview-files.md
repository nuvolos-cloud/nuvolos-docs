# Preview files

When working with the contents of files on Nuvolos, most of the time you are interacting with them from a Nuvolos application. However, the Nuvolos Web UI supports direct interaction with certain file types.

## Edit files

Nuvolos allows editing simple text files via its Web UI, which means you can open many files without needing to start an application, such as

* Files containing plaintext data (.csv, ...)&#x20;
* Plaintext files (.txt, .md, ...)
* Source code files (.py, .m, ...)

The extension of the file does not matter. To open files for edit, click of the file's name in the file navigator and select **Edit**. If you don't see the edit option, it means either the file is too large (> 1 MB) or contains data that cannot be decoded to UTF-8 characters.

## Preview files

There are a number of files that you can preview in read-only mode without starting an application:

* PDF files (.pdf)
* Notebook files (.ipynb)&#x20;

To preview supported files, click on the file's name in the file navigator and select **View**. If you don't see the **View** option, it means previewing is not supported for that file type.
