# Nuvolos CLI and Python API

### Introduction

The [Nuvolos CLI](https://github.com/nuvolos-cloud/nuvolos-cli) lets you start, stop, and execute commands in Nuvolos applications from the command line. You can access the CLI either directly from a Nuvolos application within the platform or from your personal computer.

You can also start Nuvolos applications on sizes with high CPU, memory, or GPU.

The [Nuvolos Python API](https://github.com/nuvolos-cloud/nuvolos-client-api) is a Python client for the public[ Nuvolos REST API](https://api.nuvolos.cloud/docs), offering the same functionality with a Python interface.
