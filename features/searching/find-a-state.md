# Find a state

## To find a state (snapshot or the current state):

1. From the toolbar breadcrumbs, select the organisation, the space, and the instance where the state is located.
2. Using the breadcrumbs, click on the fourth item list to open the list of states.
3. If you are looking for the current state, then it will be displayed under "Mutable States", while if you want to find a snapshot, then it will be under "Immutable Snapshots".

## Example 1: Find current state

2. Select the "Demonstration Class" space.
3. Select the "New Instance" instance.
4. Open states list.
5. Select "Current State"
