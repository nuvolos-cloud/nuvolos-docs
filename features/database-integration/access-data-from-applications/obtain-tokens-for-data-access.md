# Obtain tokens for data access

{% hint style="info" %}
Tokens are only necessary for working remotely with data in Nuvolos. Nuvolos applications are automatically set up to connect to data stored in Nuvolos.
{% endhint %}

The credentials to access data are not regular Nuvolos credentials. To obtain the required credentials to access data, please navigate to the [table view](../view-tables.md), and click the **CONNECTION GUIDE** button:

The connection guide contains important information to connect to Nuvolos from non-Nuvolos applications:

1. Username is the username with which it is possible to connect to the database back-end of Nuvolos.
2. Password is the password - which is **not** the usual Nuvolos credential - it is a string generated for only connecting to the database.
3. Finally, a convenience command is provided that contains the necessary connection information in order to access the database back-end of Nuvolos.
