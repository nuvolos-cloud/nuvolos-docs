# New applications or licenses

## Onboard new application types or new licenses

{% hint style="info" %}
When creating an application, you can pick from a list of application types and versions that are available to the particular space and organisation as your current context.
{% endhint %}

To increase the available list of application types:

1. Please reach out to us via Intercom if you need an application that is currently not on the list of available types.
2. For applications that need a commercial license to function, we have a _Bring-Your-Own-License_ model. Please contact us via Intercom to discuss technical details involved in bringing your license to Nuvolos.
