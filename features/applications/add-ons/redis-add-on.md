# Redis add-on

This add-on provides a Redis 6.2.5 data store service running on `localhost`, port 6379 which can be accessed without a password.

The data is stored in-memory, if you restart the application, all saved data will be lost.

## Visual editor for Redis

If you need a simple visual editor for Redis, we recommend using VSCode with the [VSCode Database Extension](https://github.com/cweijan/vscode-database-client).
