# I can't find my files among the Workspace files

If you cannot find the files/folder you're looking for among the Workspace files, then those files/folder were likely deleted either by you (on accident), by another instance editor or a process running in any of the applications in the instance.

Luckily, there are multiple ways that you can try to recover your data:

1. If your files are specific to a particular application, check first if the app makes regular backups. For example, JupyterLab takes regular [checkpoints](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46422176) that might be the easiest to use and most up to date.
2. You can check your [snapshots ](../../../getting-started/nuvolos-basic-concepts/snapshots.md#what-are-snapshots)if they contain the file(s). You can use distribution to [restore ](../../../features/snapshots/restore-a-snapshot.md#partially-restore-a-snapshot)them.&#x20;
3. In a teaching course, if you received the file(s) from the lecturer (for example, [assignment ](../../../user-guides/education-guides/student-guides/working-on-assignments.md)files), you can even look at the [Distributed ](../../../getting-started/nuvolos-basic-concepts/)instance to recover a version of them, as they were sent by the lecturer. The following walkthrough demonstrates how to restore 2 folder from the Distributed instance to your own instance:
   1.  First, navigate to the distributed instance of the space:\

   2.  Then, select the files you need to restore, and stage them:\

   3.  Finally, distribute them to your own instance:\

4. If none of the above helped, reach out to support, to investigate if there are any other options to recover your data.
