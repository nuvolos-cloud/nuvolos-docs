# I can't delete an application

#### If, after logging in to Nuvolos, you're having trouble deleting an application, here are some potential causes:

* **You don't have the right permission to delete an application.**

To delete an application in an instance, you need to be the editor of that instance. Instance viewers cannot delete applications. If you don't have the right permission to delete an application, contact the instance editor and discuss with him the deletion of the instance.

* **The application is running.**

Only stopped applications can be deleted. Therefore, before deleting an application check the status of the application and make sure that it is stopped.

* **Give it some time.**

Deleting an application might require several seconds, please wait for some time until it's done.

* **You are looking in the wrong place.**

To delete an application, you must be in the CURRENT STATE of an instance of which you are an editor.&#x20;

* **The application you want to delete does not exist anymore because it has already been deleted.**\

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, then the deletion request might fail to reach the server. Make sure you restore your connection,  refresh the page, and try to delete the application again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the application deletion request was not properly processed by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the application data is not served properly, making it impossible to delete the application. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page, and then try to delete the application again.\
