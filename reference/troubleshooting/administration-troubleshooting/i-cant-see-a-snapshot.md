# I can't see a snapshot

#### If, after logging in to the Nuvolos, you're having trouble finding a specific snapshot, here are some potential causes you can examine:

* **The snapshot you are looking for is not among the ones visualised.**

If you are viewing the full list of snapshots, then you need to make sure that you check the box that corresponds to the type of snapshot you are looking for. This can be an auto-backup snapshot, quick snapshot, or detailed snapshot:

* **You don't have the right permission to view the snapshot**

To view snapshots, you need to be an instance editor or viewer. If you don't have any of these roles, contact the space administrator (professor, teaching assistant, etc.) and ask her to grant you permission.

* **The snapshot does not exist anymore because it was deleted.**

A snapshot might disappear because the space admin or instance editor deleted it.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the data retrieval request might fail and the browser doesn't receive the list of snapshots from the server. Make sure you restore your connection and refresh the page.

* **There has been a server-side error and the list of snapshots was not properly served by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the snapshot data is not served properly. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page, and then check again.\
