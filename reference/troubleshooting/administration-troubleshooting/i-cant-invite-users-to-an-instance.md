# I can't invite users to an instance

#### If, after logging in to Nuvolos, you're having trouble inviting users to an instance, here are some potential causes you can examine:

* **You don't have the right permission to invite instance users.**

To invite users to an instance, you need to be a space administrator of the space where the instance is located. You can either ask a space administrator to send the invitation or grant you a space administrator role.

* **You are looking in the wrong place.**

To invite instance users, follow the steps detailed [here](../../../administration/instance-management/invite-to-an-instance.md).

* **One or more of the provided emails is invalid.**

Make sure that the user email you provide when inviting is the correct one.

* **You are inviting users to a deleted instance.**\

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the user invitation request might not reach the server and, therefore,  the invitation might not be sent to the server. Make sure you restore your connection,  refresh the page, and try to invite the users again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the invitation request was not properly served by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the invitation request is not processed properly, making it impossible to invite instance users. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page, and then try to invite the users again.\
