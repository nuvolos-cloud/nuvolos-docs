# I can't upload a file

#### If, after logging in to Nuvolos, you have trouble uploading one or more files to an instance, here are some issues you can examine:

* **You don't have the right permission to add files.**

To upload a file to an instance, you need to be an editor of that instance. Instance viewers cannot add files. If you don't have the right permission to add a file, contact the instance editor and discuss with them the file upload.

* **You followed the wrong steps for uploading the file.**

Make sure you follow the correct steps required for uploading files. For more details, check [here](../../../features/file-system-and-storage/#upload-files).

* **Give it some time.**

Adding new files might take several seconds, in particular, if the file has a large size. Please wait for some time until the operation is completed.

* **You are looking in the wrong place.**

To upload new files, you must be in the **CURRENT STATE** of an instance of which you are an editor.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the file upload operation might fail. Make sure you restore your connection,  refresh the page and, try to upload the file again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the file upload request was not properly processed by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the upload operation is not processed properly by Nuvolos. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page and, then try to upload the files again.\
