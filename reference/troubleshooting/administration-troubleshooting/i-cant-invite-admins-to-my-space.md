# I can't invite admins to my space

#### If, after logging in to Nuvolos, you're having trouble inviting space administrators, here are some potential causes you can examine:

* **You don't have the right permission to invite space administrators.**

To invite space administrators to a space, you need to have a space administrator role. If you don't have a space administrator role, you either ask a space administrator to grant you an administrator role or ask an administrator to send the administrator invitations on your behalf.

* **One or more of the provided emails is invalid.**

Make sure that the user email you provide is the correct one.

* **You are inviting users to a deleted space.**\

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the user invitation request might not reach the server and, therefore,  the invitations might not be sent. Make sure you restore your connection,  refresh the page, and try to invite again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the invitation request was not properly served by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the invitation request is not properly processed, making it impossible to invite space administrators. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page, and then try to invite the users again.\
