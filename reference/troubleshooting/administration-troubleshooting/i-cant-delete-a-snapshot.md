# I can't delete a snapshot

#### If you're having problems deleting a snapshot, here are some potential causes you might want to examine:

* **You do not have permission to delete a snapshot.**

In order to delete a snapshot, the user must have an instance editor role. If you don't have the necessary role to delete a snapshot, you can ask the instance editor to do it, or arrange an invitation for an instance editor role which will allow you to delete the snapshot.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, your request to delete a snapshot might not be received by the server. Make sure you restore your connection, refresh the page, and try to delete the snapshot again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the snapshot deletion request was not properly processed by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the snapshot deletion request is not processed properly by Nuvolos. Please wait for some time and then try to delete the snapshot again.

#### &#x20;None of these solutions worked - how to proceed?
