  If you already signed up for Nuvolos but don't remember the contact email
  address of your account, you can try one of the following approaches
---

# I forgot my email address

{% hint style="info" %}
There are 2 different email concepts on Nuvolos: the **Contact email** and the **Account email**. The contact email is where Nuvolos sends invitations and all other communications. The account email is the email reported by your IdP. Read more about this in [I forgot my identity provider](i-forgot-my-identity-provider.md).
{% endhint %}

## Locate welcome/invitation emails

Nuvolos sends all email communications to your **contact email** address. This is the address where you received your very first Nuvolos invitation.

Search your institutional or personal emails for an email with the words **\[Nuvolos] ... has sent you an invitation** or **\[Nuvolos] Welcome ...** The recipient of such messages is your contact email.

## Log in with a device you used before

Use the same browser you logged in to Nuvolos before and navigate to [app.nuvolos.cloud](https://app.nuvolos.cloud). The browser should remember the registered email and fill automatically the address box on the login page:

Then, just click **Sign-in with e-mail** and Nuvolos will take you to the right authentication method.

## Contact the person who invited you

Try to contact your organization manager or space administrator and ask if they can provide you with the email address they used to invite you to Nuvolos.\


**None of these steps workedâ€”what shall I do next?**

If you've tried each of the fixes mentioned above, and still don't remember your Nuvolos login email, please contact us at [**support@nuvolos.cloud**](mailto:support@nuvolos.cloud)**.**
