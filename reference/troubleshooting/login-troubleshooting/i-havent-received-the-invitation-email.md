# I haven't received the invitation email

#### If, after being invited to join Nuvolos, you don’t receive an invitation email, here are some fixes you can try.

* Check the Spam or Junk Mail folder.\

* Search for an email with the title “**Nuvolos has sent you an invitation**”.\

* Wait a few minutes for the invitation email to arrive.\

* Contact the class administrators to make sure that they included you in the list of invitees and that they used the correct email.\

* If you have used link-based signup, try again - perhaps you made a typo on signup.

#### None of these steps worked—what shall I do next?

If you've tried each of the fixes mentioned above, and still don't receive the invitation email, please contact us at [**support@nuvolos.cloud**](mailto:support@nuvolos.cloud)**.**
