# I can't log in to Nuvolos

## Identify your contact email

The first step is to make sure that you have a valid account. In order to log in to Nuvolos, you must have already created an account after receiving an invitation via email. Nuvolos registers as your **contact email** the address where you _received the invitation when you signed up_.&#x20;

If you cannot remember what address you used to sign up, follow the steps in [I forgot my email](i-forgot-my-email-address.md).

Once you have your contact email address, simply type it in the textbox on the login screen, and click **Sign-in with email**. Nuvolos will automatically take you to the [Identity provider](../../../reference/glossary.md#identity-provider) associated with the email.

If you signed up via your institution or Google and don't remember which account you used, see the[ I forgot my identity provider](i-forgot-my-identity-provider.md) page.

## Check your credentials

Make sure that you are typing the correct username and password. Look closely for typos, unnecessary accents, or missing characters.&#x20;

If you have signed up using an email and a password, you can reset the reset the password if you still have access to the registered email address. If you have used an external service like Google or a university identity provider and cannot log in with them, please reach out to their respective support.

## Network/Device issue

It might happen that certain networks or devices have settings that prevent you from logging in to Nuvolos. Try out the following:

* Try logging in to Nuvolos in incognito mode, to disable all browser add-ons that can interfere with the login flow. If this helped, you probably have a privacy add-on that is incompatible with Nuvolos. Disable it or use another browser.
* Try logging in to Nuvolos from a different browser or different device. If this helps, your browser or device has some settings that prevent you from logging in. Please consult the manual of your browser/device related to privacy settings.&#x20;
* Try logging to Nuvolos from a different network. Your internet provider might block certain websites necessary for Nuvolos.
