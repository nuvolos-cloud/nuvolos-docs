# I can't start an application

#### If, after logging in to Nuvolos, you're having trouble starting an application, here are some potential causes:

* **You don't have the right permission to start the application**

To start an application in an instance, you need to be the editor of that instance. Instance viewers cannot start or stop applications. If you don't have the right permission to start an application, contact the instance editor and ask her to grant you permission, or you can go to one of the instances of which you are an editor and start one of your applications.

* **The application you are trying to start is already open in another tab**

If you are trying to start an application that is already open in another tab, then this will throw an error. Check your open tabs and make sure that the application is not open.

* **You have reached the concurrency limit**

Working with Nuvolos, you are allowed to concurrently work with a limited number of applications. Once you reach the limit then you are no more able to start new applications. You can either close one of the applications you have open or contact the class/project administrator to negotiate a higher limit.

* **Give it some time.**

Starting an application might require several seconds, please wait for some time until it starts.

* **You are looking in the wrong place.**

To start an application, you must be in the CURRENT STATE of an instance of which you are an editor.&#x20;

For more information on how to find an application, check the documentation [here](../../../features/searching/find-an-application.md).

* **There is no application to start.**

Make sure that you have created the application before starting it. If you haven't created the application yet, then [create](../../../features/applications/create-an-application.md) one first and then start it.

* **The application you want to start does not exist anymore because it was deleted.**

An application might disappear because the instance editor deleted it.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the data retrieval request might fail and the browser doesn't receive the data needed to start the application. Make sure you restore your connection,  refresh the page, and try to start the application again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the application start data was not properly served by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the application data is not served properly, making it impossible to start the application. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page, and then try to start the application.\
