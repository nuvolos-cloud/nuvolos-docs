# I can't see a space

#### If, after logging in to Nuvolos, you have trouble finding a specific space (class, research project, or a dataset), then consider examining the following potential causes:

* **Make sure you are looking in the right place.**

[Here](../../../features/searching/find-a-space.md) you can find information on how to find a space.

* **The space you are looking for is not among the spaces visualised by default.**

If you are viewing the full list of spaces, then by default the list of spaces will show the first 100 spaces. If you cannot find a space then it might be because it is not shown among these 100. Simply increase the number of rows per page using the option at the bottom of the table, or navigate to the next page by using the right arrow at the bottom.

* **You are not a member of the organisation hosting the space.**

Spaces are contained in an organisation. In order to view a space you need to be part of the organisation and have a role that allows you to view the space. To view a space, you need to be one of the following: an organisation manager, a faculty member, an affiliated member with the organisation, or an external member who has been invited to join a space. If you are not a member of the organisation, you can ask the space administrator to send you an invitation to join.

* **The space does not exist any more because it was deleted.**\

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the data retrieval request might fail and the browser doesn't receive the list of spaces from the server. Make sure you restore your connection and refresh the page.

* **There has been a server-side error and the list of spaces was not properly served by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that space data is not served properly. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page, and then try again.\
