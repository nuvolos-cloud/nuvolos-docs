# I can't see an instance

#### If, after logging in to Nuvolos, you're having trouble finding a specific instance, here are some potential causes you can consider:

* **You are looking in the wrong place.**

[Here](../../../features/searching/find-an-instance.md) you can find information on how to find an instance in Nuvolos.

* **You are not a member of the space which contains the instance.**

Instances live within a space. In order to see an instance, you need to at least have a viewer role that allows you to view the instance. If you don't have the right permission, consider contacting the space admin to grant you a viewer/editor role for the instance.

* **The instance does not exist anymore because it was deleted.**

An instance might disappear because the space administrator deleted it. Contact the space administrator (professor, teaching assistant, project manager) to inquire about the issue.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, the data retrieval request might fail and the browser doesn't receive the list of instances from the server. Make sure you restore your connection and refresh the page.

* **There has been a server-side error and the list of instances was not properly served by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that instance data is not served properly. Wait for a few minutes, refresh the page, and check again.\
