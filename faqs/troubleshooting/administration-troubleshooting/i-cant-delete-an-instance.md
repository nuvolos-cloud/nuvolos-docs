# I can't delete an instance

#### If you're having problems deleting an instance, here are some potential causes you might want to examine:

* **You do not have the permission to delete an instance**

In order to delete an instance, the user must have a space administrator role. If you don't have the necessary role to delete an instance, you can contact the space administrator to delete the instance or grant you a space administrator role.

* **You are viewing the Master or Distributed instance.**

The Master and Distributed instances are primary instances that must exist for each space, therefore, they cannot be deleted.

* **You have lost connection to the internet.**

If you lose your internet connection, your request to delete an instance might not be received by the server. Make sure you restore your connection, refresh the page, and try to delete the instance again.

* **There has been a server-side error and the instance deletion request was not properly processed by Nuvolos.**

In some cases, it might happen that a server-side error occurs such that the instance deletion request is not processed properly by Nuvolos. Please wait for some time and then try to delete the instance again.
