# Introduction to Nuvolos

## What is Nuvolos?

Nuvolos is an end-to-end solution for curious minds working with data and code.

Nuvolos is a cloud-native platform, accessible at any time and from any device, that provides a digital work environment for computational and data scientists at public and private institutions. The platform enables new forms of collaborative research with higher productivity, making it easier and faster for scientists to move from idea to result. The platform saves scientists the fixed costs - effort, money and time - of setting up and maintaining the computing infrastructure they need to do their work.

It boosts research by providing limitlessly scalable computing and storage resources and best-in-class ready-for-use tools. Nuvolos enables collaboration and reproducibility with any number of colleagues in a single workspace, making data, code and applications shareable at the click of a mouse. Finally, the platform empowers learning through its flexible design. Instructors share course materials, onboard students, and ensure the reproducibility and grading of coursework in one place. Nuvolos fosters scientific progress by helping scientists and scholars find and share the next big idea faster.

## How can you use Nuvolos?

Nuvolos works by providing compute resources, file storage, configurable applications, file distribution and sharing, version control, and university course workflow tooling all in a single end-to-end platform. By making these readily available in a practical UI based in the cloud, Nuvolos removes the complexity and costs of the infrastructure that supports its three primary use cases: computational research, education, and any combination of the two.&#x20;

When using Nuvolos, therefore, you will find that getting your research project - in for example finance, or biology, or econometrics - up and running is orders of magnitude faster and easier than if you had to provide and configure all the compute resources and all the applications yourself. Nuvolos provides you with the application in its best configuration directly in the platform, ensures your files are always accessible in a familiar way (and can be synced with e.g. Dropbox), allows you to scale your compute needs up and down as you go, makes sharing your results with colleagues and referees a matter of a few mouse-clicks, and even provides versioning throughout.

Similarly, you will discover how much easier it is with Nuvolos to set up a course where students all have to use the same application (say, Virtual Studio Code) in the same configuration with the same working environment. You no longer have to worry about configuring each of the students' applications yourself correctly for all their different devices and deal with the mismatches in operating systems and libraries. It's easy to upload your own coursework materials and to distribute them to students with a few clicks, you can run applications in their own working environments to help them with problems as they do the coursework you assign, and you can even set deadlines and mark their assignments directly within the platform.

In short, for any use case where research and education meet computational needs that exceed what you can do yourself on a laptop word processor, Nuvolos has the solution, straight out of the box.

## Getting started with Nuvolos

To get started with Nuvolos, you can try out the product for free. After the trial period, you will need a Nuvolos subscription. You can obtain a Nuvolos subscription via the [pricing page](https://nuvolos.cloud/pricing) on our website. For more information, refer to our documentation on the [Nuvolos pricing structure](pricing-and-billing/pricing-structure.md).

Once you are set up with a Nuvolos subscription, check out our tutorials. We cover the research and education use cases, so you can get going quickly with the basic operations. We also explain the [basic concepts](getting-started/nuvolos-basic-concepts/) of the Nuvolos user interface, so you can navigate the platform with ease.

Should you still have questions, feel free to contact Nuvolos support at any time, either via the Intercom interface in the platform or by reaching out to us [via email](mailto:sales@nuvolos.cloud).
