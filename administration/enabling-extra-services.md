# Enabling extra services

Nuvolos supports video library, high-performance computing, and database tables services that can be enabled and disabled in a self-service manner at three different levels: [resource pool level](../pricing-and-billing/resource-pools-and-budgets.md#enabling-services-resource-pool-level), organization level, and space level. Enabling a certain feature is only possible if it is enabled at all higher levels. If the organization's resource pool does not support the feature you wish to enable, please reach out to your resource pool's manager to enable it for you.

To review or change the service settings of your organisation, go to the organisation settings as shown in the video below.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note, that disabling a feature will not disable the given feature for spaces where it has already been enabled. Spaces that already have this feature enabled will remain enabled, but the feature cannot be enabled anymore for other spaces.
