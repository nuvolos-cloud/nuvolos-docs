## Snapshot your work

1. You can take a snapshot by clicking the photo camera button once you are in the context of your instance.
2. Fill out the details. If you want a faster solution, you can just create a **quick snapshot**.

For a detailed tutorial on creating snapshots, see [Create a Snapshot](../../features/snapshots/create-a-snapshot.md).
