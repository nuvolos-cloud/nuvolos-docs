## Invite students

Once the teaching material is set up and distributed, you are ready to invite students. You are able to invite them either via invitation link (anyone clicking the link will get access to your course) or directly via e-mail.

To invite students, you can click on the 'Invite students' tile in the Overview course checklist and it will directly open the invitation dialog.

Ways to invite students to join the course :

* By sharing an Invite Link (requires the least work from the instructors' side).
* By e-mail (good for small courses)

Alternatively, more invitations options are available in the course users/instance view which can be opened from the sidebar as illustrated below
