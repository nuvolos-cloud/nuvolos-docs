## Create alternate approaches

Creating alternate approaches in your research project can be done in two steps:

1. Create a new instance with an appropriate name.
2. Distribute material from the main master instance.
3. You will need to be comfortable with context switching, we suggest to take a look at our [navigation guide](../navigate-in-nuvolos.md).

#### Create new instance

To create an instance, you need to be a [space administrator](../../administration/roles/) of your project.

1. Navigate to "Space management", denoted by the gear icon and click.
2. Select "Project Users/Instances"
3. Click Add New instance and fill out the required details.

#### Distribute material to modify

To distribute some material:

1. First navigate to the files, applications you want to distribute.
2. Click on the stage button for the objects you want to distribute.
3. Click on the distribute menu on the sidebar or on the overview.
4. Follow the steps of distribution. For more details, refer to our [detailed guide on distribution](../nuvolos-basic-concepts/distribution.md).

In the following example, we distribute two files and an application to the previously created empty instance.

Distribution is an asynchronous task - once you initiate it, it will run in the background. You will receive an e-mail with the outcome of a distribution.
If the distribution fails for some reason, do not hesitate to contact us at [support@nuvolos.cloud](mailto:support@nuvolos.cloud).
