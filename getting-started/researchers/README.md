# Getting Started for Researchers

Nuvolos offers researchers a collaborative, reproducible, and scalable environment for their projects. It streamlines the process of managing data, code, and computational environments, enabling you to focus on your research questions.

Nuvolos helps you solve the following challenges:

* **Reproducibility:** Ensuring your research is fully reproducible by capturing the complete computational environment, including data, code, and software dependencies.
* **Collaboration:** Facilitating seamless collaboration with colleagues by providing a shared environment where you can work together on code and data in real-time.
* **Data Management:** Simplifying the management of large and complex datasets, providing a centralized and secure location for your research data.
* **Scalability:** Offering scalable computational resources that can be adjusted to meet the demands of your research, from initial exploration to large-scale analysis.
* **Environment Management:** Eliminating the complexities of managing software dependencies and environments, allowing you to easily switch between different projects and configurations.
* **Preservation:** Ensuring the long-term preservation of your research outputs, including data, code, and results, in a secure and accessible format.
