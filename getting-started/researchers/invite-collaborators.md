## Invite collaborators

The creator of the project automatically becomes space admin, but every other user has to be invited specifically with that role.

To make an informed decision about the type of roles you want in your project, consult [our detailed guide](../../administration/roles/). For a more detailed guide on the invitation process, see the [Invite to a Space Guide](../../administration/space-management/invite-to-a-space.md).

### Invite co-authors with space admin rights

{% hint style="info" %}
If you invite a co-author to your project as a space admin, restricted to the project, they will receive every possible right, including the ability to invite additional co-authors, create alternate instances and deleting the project itself.

1. Navigate to your space.
2. Select the gear button on the top of the left sidebar and select "Project Users / Instances" there.
3. Click on "Invite" in the top right corner of the pane.
4. Pick "Administrator Invitation".
5. Type the e-mail address, or comma separated list of e-mail addresses.

The invitations will be sent by e-mail to the recipients who need to accept the invitation to gain the role.
