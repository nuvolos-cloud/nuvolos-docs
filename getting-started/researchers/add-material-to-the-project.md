## Add material to the project

You can add files and source code to your project via the file download/upload feature of Nuvolos. For a detailed guide on the user interface, see the [File Navigator Guide](../../features/file-system-and-storage/file-navigator.md). There are also other storage and synchronization methods, refer to those [here](../../features/file-system-and-storage/).
