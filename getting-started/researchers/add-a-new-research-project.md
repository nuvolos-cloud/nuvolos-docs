## Set up a research project

Research projects are spaces in Nuvolos where researchers can store and work on their code and data. For more details on managing spaces, see the [Space Management Guide](../../administration/space-management/README.md).

You may create research projects directly from the dashboard. Note that if you have already more than three projects, the add button will be at the bottom of your quick access group.

The project creation has two main steps:

* Naming the project and setting up privacy, potentially adding an Overview immediately.
* Choosing an application.

When you create a research project, the project initialises with an instance called "Master instance". This is where the application will also be added.
