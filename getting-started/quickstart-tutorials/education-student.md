# Education (student)

## Generate invitation

If you received an invitation link directly from your instructor, you will have to either click on it or navigate to it in your browser. The invite link should look something like this: `https://nuvolos.cloud/enroll/class/4963cd4b1355488f35f874c6f9f4116e0e`

This link will take you to a sign-up page prompting you to provide your educational institution's e-mail address. Upon successfully providing the email check the invitation message in your email inbox.



## Accept your invitation

In Nuvolos, course participation is by invitation only. To accept an invitation proceed as follows:

1. Open invitation email.
2. Click **Review Invitation** in the invitation email.
3. Inspect the roles included in the invitation.
4. If you have never signed up, sign up.
5. Click accept invitation.
6. For first-time users, the signing up process might take up to a minute to conclude.

{% hint style="danger" %}
When accepting the invitation, we encourage you to proceed with the recommended option. For students affiliated with a swiss higher education institution, this is SWITCH.

If you choose to sign up with e-mail and password authentication, the SWITCH option will not be available for you anymore.
