# Quickstart tutorials

To get started with Nuvolos quickly and without fuss, follow the basic steps in our quickstart tutorials listed below. We have provided a basic tutorial for getting started with a research project, as well as a tutorial for setting up a course as a course instructor and accepting and joining a course as a student.

This should cover the basics to get going with your project; for more detailed information, refer to the [feature descriptions](broken-reference) and the [user guides](broken-reference) for more specific walkthroughs.
