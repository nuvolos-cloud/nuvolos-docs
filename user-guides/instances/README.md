# Instance management

This page describes the various operations involved in the management of [instances](../../getting-started/nuvolos-basic-concepts/organisational-hierarchy.md#instances).

## **Create a new instance**

{% hint style="info" %}
* At the instance level, there are two types of permission that can be granted: instance editor and instance viewer. For details on the types of rights each of these roles has, please read [here](../roles/#instance-level-roles).
* Before granting access rights to an instance, make sure that the right permissions are set. Only space administrators are allowed to grant access right for an instance.
{% endhint %}

In order to create a new instance, follow our visual guide:

4. Select whether you want the instance to start from a snapshot or initialise it empty.
5. Fill out name and details.
