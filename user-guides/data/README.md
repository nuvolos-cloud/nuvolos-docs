# Working with Data

Nuvolos provides a robust and flexible environment for managing all data related to your research and teaching. This includes structured data in databases and unstructured data in the file system.

## Databases

Nuvolos includes a scalable, cloud-based SQL-compliant database management system. You can create datasets, upload data, build queries, and seamlessly access your data from within any Nuvolos application. See the guides in this section for detailed instructions on managing your databases.

## File System

The platform includes a familiar and intuitive file navigator for managing your code, documents, and other files. Nuvolos also supports integration with external storage solutions like Dropbox and S3, allowing you to synchronize or mount external data sources directly within your workspace.

## Data Integration

A key goal of the Nuvolos platform is to ensure that licensed data is accessible, annotated, and versioned, enabling more efficient and reproducible workflows.

*   **Accessibility:** Data can be accessed natively within Nuvolos applications or via standard APIs from external tools. Access can be controlled at both the organization and project level.
*   **Annotation:** To improve documentation and reusability, Nuvolos encourages and supports the annotation of data with table and column descriptions.
*   **Versioning:** The platform allows you to maintain multiple vintages of a dataset. This is critical for research reproducibility, as it enables you to reference the exact version of the data used in a specific analysis.
