# Metabase

Metabase allows you to visualize and analyze data stored in your Nuvolos tables without having to write SQL statements.

## Add a Metabase application

To add a Metabase application to your Nuvolos working instance, install a Metabase application from the application gallery:

## Running Metabase

Start your Metabase application, and when the application is loaded, you will be presented with a configuration message. It can take around a minute for Metabase to perform the initial automated configuration of the Nuvolos SDW access and the creation of the admin user within Metabase:
