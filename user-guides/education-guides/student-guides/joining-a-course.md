# Joining a course

## Generate invitation

If you received an invitation link directly from your instructor, you will have to either click on it or navigate to it in your browser. The invite link should look something like this: `https://nuvolos.cloud/enroll/class/4963cd4b1355488f35f874c6f9f4116e0e`

This link will take you to a sign-up page prompting you to provide your educational institution's e-mail address. Upon successfully providing the email check the invitation message in your email inbox.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When accepting the invitation, we encourage you to proceed with the recommended option. For students affiliated with a swiss higher education institution, this is SWITCH.
{% endhint %}
